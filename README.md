# Wayback Machine URL Checker

This is a [ThreatConnect](https://app.threatconnect.com/) playbook that gets run every time a new URL is created. It checks to see if that URL has already been archived in the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/web.php) and sends a slack message whether or not the given URL has ever been archived before.
